        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Learn to make a delicious street food, Yoimiya's specialty!</p>
        <p>Please note you need a special mold for this.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.25 cups cake flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li> 3 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>5 tbsp anko</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar and whisk well to combine.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the egg and then add the milk to combine well.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk well. Keep the batter in the refrigerator for at least one hour to rest and let the flour absorb the liquid.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into a measuring cup or jug. You should have about 1.25 cups for 5 pieces.</li>
            <li>Preheat the taiyaki maker over medium-low heat. When it's hot, grease the pan with the vegetable oil using a brush.</li>
            <li>Fill the taiyaki pan mold about 60% full.</li>
            <li>Put about 1 Tbsp of anko in the center of each mold and pour more batter on top to cover it.</li>
            <li>Close the lid and immediately flip.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2 to 2.5 minutes on that side. Then flip and cook for another 2 to 2.5 minutes. Open and check to see if the taiyaki is golden brown. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack. Continue cooking the remaining taiyaki.</li>
        </ol>
