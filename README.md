# Recipe Trial Assignment
## This assignment comes from The Odin Project.

Please constantly practice using GitHub for this.
For example, never forget to use these 3 commands when editing:
```
git add/rm <file>
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin main
```

Have fun and hopefully we learn how to add to the front page of the AI OSPE app.
